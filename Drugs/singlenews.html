                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
                    <h1>What are the health benefits of tea?</h1>
                    <img src="image/single-news.webp" alt="">
                    <p>Tea is a popular beverage consumed worldwide. Drinking tea regularly is thought to benefit your
                        health in a number of ways and may help prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke, lower your
                        risk of dementia and certain cancers, and even help you live longer.</p>
                    <h2>Why does tea have health benefits?</h2>
                    <p>Tea comes from the plant Camellia sinensis. Three common types of tea are green tea, black tea,
                        and oolong tea. These teas differ in the way they are produced and processed. Green tea is not
                        fermented, for example, whereas black tea is fermented and oolong is semi-fermented.<br><br>

                        Tea contains a range of chemicals including polyphenols, alkaloids such as caffeine, and other
                        compounds. The chemical composition of tea varies based on the species of plant, the season, the
                        climate and differences in the way the tea plants are grown, harvested and processed.<br><br>

                        Polyphenols are the main active chemical compounds found in tea and these are thought to provide
                        its health benefits. Polyphenols are micronutrients found in plants and are powerful
                        antioxidants that help to prevent and reverse cell damage. They help protect your body against
                        oxidative stress that causes cell and tissue damage, which increases your risk of developing
                        chronic diseases. Tea also has anti-inflammatory properties.<br><br>

                        Polyphenols include flavonols, theaflavins, catechins and more. The total amount of polyphenolic
                        compounds in green and black tea is similar, but the type of compounds varies. Green tea is
                        richer in catechins (including epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin,
                        epicatechin-3-gallate and epicatechin, gallocatechins and gallocatechin gallate), whereas black
                        tea contains thearubigins, theaflavins, flavonols and catechins.</p>
                    <h2>Which health conditions does tea drinking help?</h2>
                    <h3>Tea may lower your risk of dementia</h3>
                    <p>Drinking a moderate amount of tea significantly reduces your risk of dementia, including
                        Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, according to the results of a large study that
                        followed 377, 592 people for about 9 years.<br><br>

                        Participants who drank 1 to 4 cups of tea a day were 16 to 19 percent less likely to develop
                        Alzheimer’s disease. Vascular dementia was also reduced by 25 to 29 percent in participants who
                        drank 1 to 6 cups of tea a day. Drinking more tea, however, was not associated with any
                        additional benefit.<br><br>

                        Drinking three cups of tea a day was found to provide the strongest protection against dementia.
                        Middle-aged participants and men appeared to benefit the most.</p>
                    <h3>Tea may help you live longer</h3>
                    <p>Drinking 2 or more cups of tea a day resulted in a modest decrease in the risk of dying among
                        nearly 500,000 participants in a study who were followed-up for a median of 11.2 years after
                        completing a questionnaire about their tea intake. The study looked at death from all causes,
                        including cancer, cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, stroke and respiratory
                        disease.<br><br>

                        The researchers commented that the results suggest tea can be part of a healthy diet, even when
                        quite a lot is consumed.</p>
                    <h3>Tea may keep your heart healthy</h3>
                    <p>People who drank 1 to 3 cups of green tea a day were found to have a reduced risk of heart attack
                        and stroke compared with people who drank less than a cup of green tea a day, when researchers
                        looked at the results from 9 studies involving nearly 260,000 participants.<br><br>

                        Various studies have also shown that the polyphenolic compounds in tea may help prevent
                        atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque in your arteries, and reduce ‘bad’ low-density
                        lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Tea may also help slow the natural decrease of ‘good’
                        high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol that happens as you get older. Regular long-term
                        consumption of black tea may even lower your blood pressure, helping to keep your heart healthy.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tea may reduce your risk of certain cancers</h3>
                    <p>Although results from studies have been inconclusive, drinking tea, especially green tea, may
                        also help prevent or slow the growth of cancer. It’s not known exactly how tea helps, but it may
                        be due to its antioxidant properties.<br><br>

                        Some studies have linked tea drinking to a reduction in the risk of certain cancer including
                        colon, lung, prostate, ovary, breast and other cancers.<br><br>

                        An analysis of several studies conducted in participants with breast cancer indicated that
                        drinking three or more cups of green tea a day may lower the recurrence of breast cancer,
                        particularly in women that have stage I or II breast cancer.<br><br>

                        A high intake of green tea (> 10 cups/day) was also associated with a lower risk of colon,
                        liver, and lung cancers.<br><br>

                        The benefits of black tea on cancer have not been studied as extensively as green tea. However,
                        a small study found that people consuming hot black tea with citrus peel had a significant
                        reduction in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, a type of skin cancer.<br><br>

                        Black tea may also help reduce the risk of colon cancer and may provide a protective effect
                        against lung cancer in non-smoking women.</p>
                    <h3>Tea may lower your risk of diabetes</h3>
                    <p>Tea may also help prevent diabetes mellitus and complications such as diabetic retinopathy and
                        diabetic nephropathy. The antidiabetic properties of tea are attributed to the theaflavins,
                        catechins, polysaccharides and caffeine it contains.<br><br>

                        Tea may help to lower your risk of diabetes in a number of ways, such as by inhibiting
                        inflammation, promoting the production and secretion of insulin, and improving insulin
                        resistance and sensitivity.<br><br>

                        According to the combined results of 17 trials involving 1133 participants, green tea lowers
                        fasting glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c (Hb A1c) concentrations. Hb A1c is measured to assess
                        how well diabetes is being controlled over time.<br><br>

                        The Women's Health Study, which included 39,876 women aged 45 years and older, found that women
                        who drank 4 or more cups of green tea per day had a 30 percent lower risk of type 2 diabetes
                        than women who did not drink tea.</p>
                    <h3>Tea may help lower your risk of rheumatoid arthritis</h3>
                    <p>Consuming 3 or more cups of tea per day may help prevent the onset of rheumatoid arthritis,
                        according to the results of a study involving 31,336 women. Rheumatoid arthritis is an
                        autoimmune disease that causes joints to become inflamed and the surrounding cartilage and bone
                        to be worn away. The disease affects more women than men.<br><br>

                        Tea also appears to help increase bone mineral density in older women. Low bone density can
                        cause people with rheumatoid arthritis and others to be more at risk of fractures and
                        osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bone.<br><br>

                        The anti-inflammatory properties of tea may help reduce the inflammation associated with
                        rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
